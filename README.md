# NextJS-3D
## The goal
The question from the stakeholder was: "Is there a way to create a 3D or 360Â° view environment within a web application?". So, I decided to create a proof of concept with a 3D environment. The goal is to create a 3D environment where the user can move around the environment. The environment is created with the help of `three.js` and `babylon.js`. With the arrow keys the user can change the image. You can also move the camera with your mouse.

## Protypes
* Three.js prototype: [https://nsmnia.github.io/NextJS-3D/](https://nsmnia.github.io/NextJS-3D/)
* Babylon.js prototype: [https://nsmnia.github.io/NextJS-3D/babylon](https://nsmnia.github.io/NextJS-3D/babylon)

## Conclusion
Because `three.js` is more widely used than `babylon.js`, I believe it is a superior choice. I believe this is a better solution because more is known about it and more individuals have made the same error, making it easier to solve comparable difficulties. This is also demonstrated in this proof of concept.
